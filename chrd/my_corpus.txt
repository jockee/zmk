y most common word it would grab the now chord whi ch i guess is the same as the won chord should we build a db os if soof sorted strigs as keys my goal is to build a db of what chords shold lead should lead to eac h of my most common words build upon my analyze_chords py ggvg y --don i don t really don t display if something is chordable or not if something is chordable display its assigned chord also if something is chordable but got assigned a n existing chord and there fore is unchorded show me that vg w one letter words sho would i realistically somehoe w chord them into chcharacter+space or just press the character and space what the chord would be pressing a and space simultaneous ly of course no other thing else should be represented by this specific chord chording one letter words letter what would be a good chordsehow would i enchord a> holding a + single character + space makes senes se add this to my chordanalyzechords py /print nvg wq less q q ive just key loggged ed ged for a few minutes so this is nt perhaps representative o f what i normally type but how do i gt et more words chordable do i start adding ngramsccommon ngrams>help me write the script to accomplish this my normal chordsfor my normal chords i would want to add space at the end does this mean i cant chord how would i chord something some would output a space afeteafter i dont really li dont see a perfect soluton ion here i woul d want to not have to remember which words come with automatic space and which do not either i choose not to chord the beginning ngrams taht hat are words by themselves meaning to aleways ways be ablr e to expect a space for world d chords and not for ngram chords or i skip chording ngrams at allother ideas th pressing a button not to input space after a chord i s pretty brilliant i use or rather i will use i use a glove80 which uand currently use their own and zm mi want to 1 1 collect common words2 generate my chords from my most common words3 create a zmk config how do i define my cjhordchords in zmk will my zmk config perhaps be too long with all my vhords chords defined sounds good backl to to finding chords i wan t the script to bea able to detect that something is chordable by some + thing assuming those two are in fact chordable kko wjj/known nnnnjjkko vkkjvkkkkkdjjjuuugive me the full analyze_chords py ggg wq gsome ngrams are bound o be common enough to be their own macros should we star t there or start with words if we onassuit would b e nice to know how many macros we can define before setting these requi skip the outputting to zmk format for now 2 sounds great though ggvg wq h hae ve the most common words been deducted from the chording rd seems off somehow why exactly i want it to find ngrams such as ing that combines well with others how do i program this -< > why woukd ld this matter it eally doesn t seem to sliightly favor these but dont exclyde anything thats not full script ggvg w why is chording in zmk/qmksoftware not more common seems like it should be very fast chord maare there any chord mappings online to draw imspiration from want to know which ngrams to include if bigrams are worthwhile chchord can we get a list of chords available in master forge i want a list of chords a mapping ge kjoiojget a list of master forge chords 1 xiis there no chord mapping is it open source is is chording such small ngrams as th worth it does it combine wel with other ngrams assgive me a spit out some type if json file in the chord generator mappig ng generator which i can then use in a separate script to analyze a corpus and see how much is a chordable vgggg wwrite a script that takes in the mapping and a corpus as args and calculates how well the chords worked over the corpus
