    On each press (after the first), it sends backspaces to delete the
    previously typed string, then types the next string in the sequence.

      Index of the string list to cycle through. The lists are defined
      in the behavior's C code (behavior_cycle_string.c). Index 0
      corresponds to the first list defined, index 1 to the second, etc.
